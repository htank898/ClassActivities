// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
let currentnumber = 1;
let currenttotal = 0;

while (currentnumber <= 100) {
  console.log(currentnumber += currenttotal);
  currentnumber++;
}


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
let total = 0;

for (let cnumber = 1; cnumber <= 100; cnumber++) {
total += cnumber;
}
